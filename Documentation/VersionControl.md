# Source Code Version Control Tools

##Introduction
Version Control is essential in Software Development to track changes and rollback changes whenever serious bugs occur. Version control maintains integrity in software development by tracking who made what changes when. This helps to prevent programmers from claiming false credit or from shirking responsibility for breaking code.

However integrity should be held way before this point, as version control systems normally prevent changes from being made until they are pushed/commited with additional code review systems to . This means said programmer who submits broken code should have it caught before it breaks the project. 

Version Control is also extremely helpful in saving the history of a project. Since version control asks users to save any changes made to code or documents as a new version of the file, old files won't be overwritten like they are without using version control. This allows you to review older files of a project in the event of any errors and allows you to even rollback and entire project to an older version if needed.

Version Control helps with collaboration by allowing developers to freely update files without having to leave other members of the team behind. Other Team members can see when code has been changed and with version control systems like github they can just pull the changed repository to be back on track. Github and other verso control systems can also be used to resolve conflicting changes with simple commands instead of going through an intense review process.
