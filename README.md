# Read Me

Created by Joseph C

This is a basic devcontainer for Ubuntu that is designed to be used to develop a simple flutter app for an app development course. It should work on any machine that has docker desktop, though VSCode may also be required. It just uses the flutter feature for Ubuntu alongside flutter and dart extensions to install flutter. A post create command of sudo chmod is used to change file permissions so the flutter create and run -d web-server commands will work correctly.

This container currently includes the default app in flutter labeled basicapp for testing the container. Feel free to delete it and create your own app to verify flutter is installed correctly.

# Container Read me

This container should work on any intel machine. If it doesn't please let me know (Addressed to my professor, but any visitor is welcome to leave a comment).

For detailed instructions on how to run the container and how to perform some basic tasks in the container follow the [Devcontainer Readme](https://github.com/JosephCGit/JCDevContainer/blob/main/Documentation/DevContainer.md)
