# Read Me

Created by Joseph C

This repository is being used for a project where I will create a flutter app and a pipeline to maintain the flutter app currently this repository just contains a basic devcontainer for Ubuntu that is designed to be used to develop a simple flutter app for an app development course. It should work on any machine that has [docker desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/), though [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) may also be required. You can just install it here.

This container currently includes the default app in flutter labeled basicapp for testing the container. Feel free to delete it and create your own app to verify flutter is installed correctly. For a guide on Git repositories and commands to use them follow the [Version Control Readme](https://github.com/JosephCGit/JCDevContainer/blob/main/Documentation/VersionControl.md)

# Container Read me

This container should work on any intel machine. If it doesn't please let me know (Addressed to my professor, but any visitor is welcome to leave a comment).

For detailed instructions on how to run the container and how to perform some basic tasks in the container follow the [Devcontainer Readme](https://github.com/JosephCGit/JCDevContainer/blob/main/Documentation/DevContainer.md)
